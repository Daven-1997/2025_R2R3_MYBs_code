Specificity landscapes of 40 R2R3-MYBs reveal how paralogs target different cis-elements by homodimeric binding

This research mainly includes the following analyses:

- fig1: The landscape of binding specificity of VIII R2R3-MYBs.

- fig2: Modified specificities of closely spaced AtMYB2 homodimers.

- fig3: The modified specificities are unique to AtMYB2.

- fig4: The modified specificities allow AtMYB2 to recognize additional genomic sites.
  
- fig5: The modified specificities of AtMYB2 are functional to activate transcription.

- fig6: The modified specificities of AtMYB2 are conserved in evolution.
